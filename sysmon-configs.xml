    <!-- All processes launched will be logged, except for what matches a rule below? Be as specific as possible to avoid user-mode xecutables imitating other proccesses 
      to avoid logging, or if malware dorps files in an existing directory. Beware of masquerading, where attackers imitage the names and paths of legitimate tools. 
      Ideally, you'd use both files and path and code signatures to validate, buth sysmon does not support that. For this, look into AppLocker/WindowsDeviceGuard for 
      whitelisting support -->
