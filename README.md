# ccdc-stuffs

This repo is to be filled with imporant things for CCDC 

I will be starting out with understaing sysmon and windows telemetry and attempt to build one of my own for ccdc
I will also include splunk queries that can be used to detect threats 
Next, I will look into how I can use BLUESPAWN for threat detection and send those to splunk for IR reporting during the competitions
